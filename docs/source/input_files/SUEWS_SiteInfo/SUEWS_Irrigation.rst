~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

External water use may be used for a wide range of reasons (e.g. cleaning roads, irrigating plants, fountains, washing cars).

SUEWS has two options for External Water use (if non- zero)
1) provide observed data in meteorological forcing file in the `Wuh` column with valid values
  set `WaterUseMethod` = 1 in `RunControl.nml`
  
2) a simple model that calculates daily water use from the mean daily air temperature, number of days since rain and fraction of
irrigated area using automatic/manual irrigation. The user needs to supply coefficients (XXX) for these relations. 
 a) sub-daily pattern of water use is detemined from the daily cycles specified in `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`.
 b) surface that the water can be applied to is specified by XX.
 c) water can pond
